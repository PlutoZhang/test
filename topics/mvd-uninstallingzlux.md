# Uninstalling zLUX

To uninstall zLUX, complete the following steps:

1. Stop the server. (The server responds to standard process signals such as SIGHUP, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL.)

1. Delete the original folders (except in the case where you have customized the installation to point to folders other than the original folders).
