# Dataset APIs

Use Dataset APIs to create, read, update, delete, and list data sets. See the following table for the operations available in Dataset APIs and their descriptions and prerequisites.

|REST API|Description|Prerequisite|
|--------|-----------|-------------|
|`GET /Atlas/api/datasets/{filter}`|Get a list of data sets by filter. Use this API to get a starting list of data sets, for example, **userid.\*\***.|z/OSMF restfiles|
|`GET /Atlas/api/datasets/{dsn}/attributes`|Retrieve attributes of a data set\(s\). If you have a data set name, use this API to determine attributes for a data set name. For example, it is a partitioned data set.|z/OSMF restfiles|
|`GET /Atlas/api/datasets/{dsn}/members`|Get a list of members for a partitioned data set. Use this API to get a list of members of a partitioned data set.|z/OSMF restfiles|
|`GET /Atlas/api/datasets/{dsn}/content`|Read content from a data set or member. Use this API to read the content of a sequential data set or partitioned data set member. Or use this API to return a checksum that can be used on a subsequent `PUT` request to determine if a concurrent update has occurred.|z/OSMF restfiles|
|`PUT /Atlas/api/datasets/{dsn}/content`|Write content to a data set or member. Use this API to write content to a sequential data set or partitioned data set member. If a checksum is passed and it does not match the checksum that is returned by a previous `GET` request, a concurrent update has occurred and the write fails.|z/OSMF restfiles|
|`POST /Atlas/api/datasets/{dsn}`|Create a data set. Use this API to create a data set according to the attributes that are provided. The API uses z/OSMF to create the data set and uses the syntax and rules that are described in the *z/OSMF Programming Guide*.|z/OSMF restfiles|
|`POST /Atlas/api/datasets/{dsn}/{basedsn}`|Create a data set by using the attributes of a given base data set. When you do not know the attributes of a new data set, use this API to create a new data set by using the same attributes as an existing one.|z/OSMF|
|`DELETE /Atlas/api/datasets/{dsn}`|Delete a data set or member. Use this API to delete a sequential data set or partitioned data set member.|z/OSMF restfiles|
