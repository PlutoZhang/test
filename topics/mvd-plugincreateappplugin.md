# Creating an application plug-in

This information is under development.

A zLUX application plug-in is a separately installable collection of files that can provide a set of web resources \(JavaScript, HTML, and so on\) that can be presented in the user interface as window \(or as an embedded panel\) or a set of RESTful services, or both RESTful services and user interfaces.

Before you can begin building a zLUX application plug-in, you must set the environment variables that are necessary to support the plug-in environment.

sample-app is a sample application plug-in with which you can experiment.

-   **[Setting the environment variables for plug-in development](mvd-pluginsetenvvars.md)**  
The UNIX environment variables must be set appropriately before you can use the zLUX build procedures to develop your own plug-ins.
-   **[Experimenting with the sample application plug-in](mvd-pluginexpsampapp.md)**  
Your zLUX installation provides a sample application plug-in with which you can experiment.
