# Atlas overview

This is testing... ...

Atlas is a z/OS® RESTful web service and deployment architecture for z/OS microservices. Atlas is implemented as a Liberty Profile web application that uses z/OSMF services to provide a range of APIs for the management of jobs, data sets, z/OS UNIX™ System Services files, and persistent data. ss

Atlas can be used by any client application that calls its RESTful APIs directly..

As a deployment architecture, Atlas accommodates the installation of other z/Tool microservices into its Liberty instance. These microservices can be used by Atlas APIs and client applications.
