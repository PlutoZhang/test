# Using Atlas Explorers within zLUX
Atlas provides a sample web client that can be used to view and manipulate the Job Entry Subsystem (JES), data sets, z/OS UNIX System Services (USS), and System log.

The following views are available from the Atlas Web UI and are accesible via the Atlas icon located in the application draw of MVD (Navigation between views can be performed using the menu draw located in the top left corner of the Atlas Web UI):

**JES Explorer**

  Use this view to query JES jobs with filters, and view the related steps, files, and status. You can also purge jobs from this view.

**Syslog**

  Use this view to see the system log by using a web socket. Whenever messages are written, the view is refreshed automatically.

  You can also open a JES spool file for an active job and view its content that is refreshed through a web socket.

**Dataset Explorer**

  Use this view to browse the MVSâ„¢ file system by using a high-level qualifier filter. With the Dataset Explorer, you can complete the following tasks:
    - List the members of partitioned data sets.
    - Create new data sets using attributes or the attributes of an existing data set ("Allocate Like").
    - Submit data sets that contain JCL to Job Entry Subsystem (JES).
    - Edit sequential data sets and partitioned data set members with basic syntax highlighting and content assist for JCL and REXX.
    - Conduct basic validation of record length when editing JCL.
    - Delete data sets and members.
    - Open data sets in full screen editor mode, which gives you a fully qualified link to that file. The link is then reusable for example in help tickets.

**UNIX file Explorer**

  Use this view to browse the USS files by using a path. With the UNIX file Explorer, you can complete the following tasks:
    - List files and folders.
    - Create new files and folders.
    - Edit files with basic syntax highlighting and content assist for JCL and REXX.
    - Delete files and folders.
