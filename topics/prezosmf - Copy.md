## z/OSMF Requirements for Project Giza
Meet the following prerequisites before you use Project Giza:

- [z/OS requirements](#zos-requirements)
- [z/OSMF plug-in requirements](#zosmf-plug-in-requirements)
- [REST services requirements](#rest-services-requirements)

### z/OS requirements
Ensure that your z/OS system meets the following requirements for z/OSMF to function properly with Project Giza:

- **AXR (System Rexx)** -
    The AXR (System Rexx) component lets z/OS perform Incident Log tasks. It also lets REXX execs execute outside of conventional TSO and batch environments.
- **CEA (Communications Enabled Applications) Server** -
    CEA server is a co-requisite for the CIM server. The CEA server lets z/OSMF deliver z/OS events to C-language clients.
    - Start the CEA server before you start the start z/OSMF (the IZU* started tasks).
    - Set up CEA server in Full Function Mode and assign the TRUSTED attribute to the CEA started task.
    - For more information, see Customizing for CEA on the IBM Knowledge Center.
- **CIM (Common Information Model) Server** -
   z/OSMF requires the CIM server to perform capacity provisioning and workload management tasks. Start the CIM server before you start z/OSMF (the IZU* started tasks).
    - For more information, see Reviewing your CIM server setup on the IBM Knowledge Center.
- **Console Command** -
    The CONSOLE and CONSPROF commands must exist in the authorized command table.
- **IBM z/OS Provisioning Toolkit** -
    The IBM® z/OS® Provisioning Toolkit is a command line utility that lets you provision z/OS development environments. The product is required if you want to provision CICS or Db2 environments with Brightside CLI.
- **Java version** -
    IBM® 64-bit SDK for z/OS®, Java Technology Edition V7.1 or higher is required.
    - For more information, see Software prerequisites for z/OSMF on the IBM Knowledge Center.
- **Maximum region size** -
    To prevent exceeds maximum region size errors, ensure that you have a TSO maximum region size of at least 65536 KB for the z/OS system.
- **User IDs** -
    User IDs require a TSO segment (access) and an OMVS segment. During workflow processing and REST API requests, z/OSMF may start one or more TSO address spaces under the following job names:
    - userid
    - substr(userid, 1, 6)||CN (Console)

For more information, refer to the IBM z/OSMF documentation.

### z/OSMF plug-in requirements
Ensure that the following IBM z/OSMF plug-ins are installed and configured:

- **(Optional) Cloud Portal** -
    The Cloud Portal plug-in lets you make software services available to marketplace consumers and it adds the Marketplace and Marketplace Administration tasks to the z/OSMF navigation tree.
- **Configuration Assistant** -
    The Configuration Assistant plug-in lets z/OSMF configure TCP/IP policy-based networking functions.
- **ISPF** -
    The ISPF plug-in lets z/OSMF access traditional ISPF applications.
- **Workload Management** -
    The Workload Management plug-in lets z/OSMF operate and manage workload management service definitions and policies.

For more information about configuring each z/OSMF plug-in and the related security, refer to the IBM z/OSMF documentation for each plug-in.

### REST services requirements
Ensure that the following REST services are configured and available when you run Project Giza:

- **Cloud provisioning services** -
    Cloud provisioning for development environments. Cloud provisioning services are required for the Brightside CLI cics and db2 command groups to function properly. Endpoints begin with `/zosmf/provisioning/`
- **TSO/E address space services** -
    Required to issue TSO commands in Brightside CLI. Endpoints begin with `/zosmf/tsoApp`
- **z/OS console** -
    Required to issue console commands in Brightside CLI. Endpoints begin with `/zosmf/restconsoles/`
- **z/OS data set and file interface** -
    Required to work with mainframe data sets and USS files in Brightside CLI. Endpoints begin with `/zosmf/restfiles/`
- **z/OS jobs interface** -
    Required to use the zos-jobs command group in Brightside CLI. Endpoints begin with `/zosmf/restjobs/`
- **z/OSMF workflow services** -
    Cloud provisioning for development environments. Cloud provisioning services are required for the Brightside CLI cics and db2 command groups to function properly. Endpoints begin with `/zosmf/workflow/`

Additionally, Project Giza uses z/OSMF configuration by using symbolic links to the
z/OSMF `bootstrap.properties`, `jvm.security.override.properties`, and the
`ltpa.keys` files. Specifically, Project Giza reuses z/OSMF's SAF, SSL, and LTPA
configuration; therefore, these configurations must be valid and complete to
operate Project Giza successfully.

For more information, refer to the IBM z/OSMF documentation for each REST service.

## Configuring z/OSMF
Follow these steps to verify your system requirements:

1. For z/OS v2.2 or later, use any of the following options to determine which version is installed:
    - If you have access to the console, for example, in SDSF, issue the command:

        ```
        /D IPLINFO
        ```

        Part of the output contains the release, for example,

        `RELEASE z/OS 02.02.00.`

    - If you don't have access to the console, use SDSF and select the menu option **MAS**. Two columns of the output show the SysName (LPAR name) and the z/OS version, for example:

        `SysName  Version`

        `S001     z/OS 2.2`

        Identify the z/OS Version for the LPAR on which you are going to use z/OSMF.

    - If you don't have access to SDSF, use ISPF option **7.3** (Dialog Test Variables) and scroll down to the variable `ZOS390RL`, for example,

        `ZOS390RL S N z/OS   02.02.00`

    - On the ISPF Primary Option Menu, the last entry is the ISPF Release, which corresponds to the z/OS version as follows:

        Release . : ISPF 7.1    --> z/OS v2.1

        Release . : ISPF 7.2    --> z/OS v2.2

        Release . : ISPF 7.3    --> z/OS v2.3

2. Configure z/OSMF. For z/OS V2.2 users, take the following steps to configure z/OSMF:

    z/OSMF is a base element of z/OS v2.2 and v2.3, so it should already be installed. However, it is not guaranteed to be configured and running on every z/OS V2.2 and V2.3 system.

    Configuring an instance of z/OSMF is done by running the IBM-supplied jobs IZUSEC and IZUMKFS, and then starting the z/OSMF server in the following order:

    1. Security setup (the IZUSEC job)
    2. Configuration (the IZUMKFS job)
    3. Server initialization (the START command)     

    For z/OS V2.3 users, the base element z/OSMF is started by default at system IPL. This means that z/OSMF is available for use as soon as the system is up. If you prefer not to have z/OSMF started automatically, you can disable the autostart function by checking for `START` commands for the z/OSMF started procedures in the COMMNDxx parmlib member.

    The z/OS Operator Consoles task is new in this release. Applications that depend on access to the operator console such as Brightside's RestConsoles API require version 2.3.

3. Verify other requirements.

    - Perform any maintenance that is required by Node.js.

        Connect to your target z/OS system, for example, with ssh to port 22 to get a USS command window. Issue the command:

        ```
        node -v
        ```

        The response should be:

        `v6.11.2`

        or later. If the version displayed is not right, set and/or download the right version of node by using npm and nvm. You might want to refer to the following links for tutorials on npm and nvm:

        https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/

        https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/

        If you don’t have node installed, go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/, select your operating system, and follow the instructions to install node. Ensure that you download only official versions of these products. For z/OSMF, you need only one version of node.js. You can find the complete procedure for installing Node.js at https://developer.ibm.com/node/sdk/ztp/.

        When completed, set the `NODE_HOME` environment variable to the directory where your Node.js is installed, for example,

        ```
        NODE_HOME=/proj/mvd/node/installs/node-v6.10.3-os390-s390x
        ```

    - Issue the following command to check the Java installation.

        ```
        java -version
        ```

        The response should be

        `java version "1.8.0"`

        or later. If the version displayed is not right, set the `JAVA_HOME` variable to point to the preferred java version. If the preferred java version is not installed, install it.

    - Verify that you have 400 MB of free HFS file space for the installation. You can use the `df` command to check the available space in your chosen file system, for example,

        ```
        df -k /usr/lpp/zosmf
        ```

        The output should be as follows:

        ```
        Mounted on       Filesystem               Avail/Total

        /Z22C/usr/lpp/zosmf  (ZFS.S001.Z22C.ZOSMF)      26711/535680
        ```

        From the output above, you can see that only 26.711 MB is available (because z/OSMF is already installed), but the total in that file system is 535.68 MB, so enough space was available when the file system was created.

   - Verify your browser support. Confirm that the machine from which you plan to run the Giza desktop runs one of the supported browsers:
        - Chrome version 54 or later
        - Firefox version 44 or later
        - Microsoft Edge

      **Note**: Microsoft Internet Explorer is not yet supported at any version.

4.After configuring z/OSMF, verify the following items to ensure z/OSMF is ready for Project Giza.

   Check that the z/OSMF server and angel processes are running. From SDSF on z/OS, use the `DA` command or issue the following command on the command input line:

   ```
   /D A,IZU*
   ```

   If you don't see jobs like IZUANG1 and IZUSVR1 active, start the angel process with the following command:

   ```
   /S IZUANG1
   ```

   When you see the message **CWWKB0056I INITIALIZATION COMPLETE FOR ANGEL**, start the server with the following command:

   ```
   /S IZUSVR1
   ```

   The server might take a couple of minutes to fully initialize. The z/OSMF server is available when the following message **CWWKF0011I: The server zosmfServer is ready to run a smarter planet.** is displayed.

   You can test z/OSMF with your browser by first finding the startup messages in the SDSF log of the z/OSMF server by using the following find command:

   ```
   f IZUG349I
   ```

   You should see these lines:

   `IZUG349I: The z/OSMF STANDALONE Server home page can be accessed at  https://mvs.hursley.ibm.com:443/zosmf after the z/OSMF server is started on your system.`

   From the lines above, the port number is 443. You will need this port number later.

   Point your browser at the nominated z/OSMF STANDALONE Server home page and you should see its Welcome Page where you can log in.

## Verifying your z/OSMF configuration
To verify that IBM z/OSMF REST services are configured correctly in your environment, type the REST endpoint into your browser. For example: https://mvs.ibm.com:443/zosmf/restjobs/jobs

**Notes:**
- Browsing z/OSMF endpoints requests your user ID and password for defaultRealm; these are your TSO user credentials.

- Your browser should return you a status code 200 with a list of all jobs on your z/OS system. The list is in raw JSON format.

### Optional method for verifying z/OSMF configuration with Brightside CLI    

To verify that IBM z/OSMF is configured correctly, follow these steps to create and validate a profile in Brightside CLI:

1. [Meet the prerequisites for Brightside CLI](precli.md).
2. [Install Brightside CLI](cli-installcli.md).
3. Create a zosmf profile in Brightside CLI. Issue the `bright help explain profiles` command to learn more about creating profiles in Brightside CLI. See [How to display Brightside CLI help](cli-howtodisplaybrightsidehelp.md) for more information.
4. [Validate your profile](cli-validateInstallation.md).
5. [Use the profile validation report to identify and correct errors](cli-validateInstallationcorrectproblems.md) with your z/OSMF configuration.
    If you recieve a perfect score on the validation report, Project Giza can communicate with z/OSMF properly.

**Note:** Before your run the profile validation, check that JES2 is accepting jobs with CLASS=C by issuing the following command in SDSF:

```/$D I```

You will see responses like the following in SYSLOG:

```$HASP892 INIT(3)   STATUS=ACTIVE,CLASS=AB,...```

If none of the initiators has **C** in its CLASS list, add **C** to the list of any initiator. For example, initiator 3 as shown above, with the following command:

```/$T I3,CL=ABC```
