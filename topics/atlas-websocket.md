# Using Atlas WebSocket services
Atlas provides WebSocket services that can be accessed by using the WSS scheme.
With Atlas WebSocket services, you can view the system log in the System log UI
that is refreshed automatically when messages are written. You can also open a JES
spool file for an active job and view its contents that refresh through a web socket.
