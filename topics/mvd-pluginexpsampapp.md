# Experimenting with the zLUX sample application plug-in

Your zLUX installation provides a sample application plug-in with which you can experiment.

To build the sample app, node and npm must be included in the PATH. You can use the `npm run build` or `npm start` command to build the sample application plug-in. These commands are configured in `package.json`.

**Note:** 

- Be aware that whenever you change the source code for the sample application, you must subsequently rebuild the sample application.

- If you want to modify sample-app, you must run `_npm install_` in the virtual-desktop and the `sample-app/webClient`. Then, you can run `_npm run build_` in `sample-app/webClient`.

1.   Try adding an item to sample-app. The following figure shows the unmodified contents of `app.component.ts`:

    ```
    
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    
    @Component({
      selector: 'app-root',
      templateUrl: './app.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
    })
    export class AppComponent {
      items = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
      title = 'app';
    }
    ```

2.   Save your changes to `app.component.ts`. 
3.   Issue one of these commands: 
    -   `npm run build` to rebuild the application plug-in.
    -   `npm start` to rebuild the application plug-in and wait for additional changes to `app.component.ts`.
4.   Reload the web page. 
5.   Whenever you make changes to the sample application source code, you must subsequently rebuild the application: 
    1.   Navigate to the sample-app subdirectory where you made the source code changes. 
    2.   Issue this command: `npm run build` 
    3.   Reload the web page.
