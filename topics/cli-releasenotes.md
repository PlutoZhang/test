# Brightside CLI overview

Brightside Command Line Interface (Brightside CLI) lets
application developers interact with the mainframe in a format that is
natively familiar to them. Brightside CLI helps to increase overall
productivity, reduce the learning curve for developing mainframe
applications, and exploit the ease-of-use of off-platform tools.
Brightside CLI lets application developers use common tools such
as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), shell commands, bash
scripts, and build tools for mainframe development. It provides a set of
utilities and services for application developers who need to quickly
become efficient in supporting and building z/OS applications.

Brightside CLI provides the following benefits:

  - Enables and encourages developers with limited z/OS expertise to
    build, modify, and debug z/OS applications.
  - Fosters the development of new and innovative tools from a personal
    computer that can interact with z/OS operating systems.
  - Ensure that business critical applications running on z/OS can be
    maintained and supported by existing and generally available
    software development resources.
  - Provides a more streamlined way to build software that integrates
    with z/OS platforms. 

The following sections explain the key features and details for Brightside CLI.

**Note:** For installation, upgrade, and software requirements, see [Installing Brightside CLI](cli-installcli.md).

## Brightside CLI capabilities

With Brightside CLI, you can interact with z/OS remotely in the
following ways:

  - **Interact with mainframe files**    
  
    Create, edit, download, and upload mainframe files (data sets) directly from Brightside CLI. 

  - **Submit jobs**    
  
    Submit JCL from data sets or local storage, monitor the status, and view and download the output automatically.

  - **Issue TSO and z/OS console commands**    
  
    Issue TSO and console commands to the mainframe directly    from Brightside CLI.

  - **Provision mainframe environments**    
  
    Exploit z/OSMF cloud provisioning features to provision environments on-demand.

  - **Integrates z/OS actions**    
  
    Build local scripts that accomplish both mainframe and local tasks. 

  - **Produce responses as JSON documents**    
  
    Return data in JSON format on request for consumption in other programming languages.
