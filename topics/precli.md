# Prerequisites for Brightside CLI

Meet the following prerequisites before you install Brightside CLI on your PC:

- Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime environment on which we
architected Brightside CLI. You use the Node.js package manager (npm) to install Brightside CLI. Follow the instructions at [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) to install Node.js on your operating system.  

    **Tip:** If you are installing Node.js on a Linux or a macOS
    operating system, CA recommends that you install `nodejs` and
    `nodejs-legacy` using the instructions on the Nodejs website (using
    package manager). For example, you can install nodejs-legacy using
    the command `sudo apt install nodejs-legacy`. With `nodejs-legacy`,
    you can issue `node` commands rather than typing
    `nodejs`.

- You can install Brightside CLI on any Windows, macOS, and Linux operating system that supports Node.js version 6 or
later.

- Before you can use Brightside CLI to interact with the
mainframe, a systems programmer must install and configure IBM z/OSMF in
your environment.

**Note:** CA Technologies does not maintain the prerequisite software
that Brightside CLI requires. You are responsible for updating Node.js
and other prerequisites on your personal computer or workstation. We
recommend that you update Node.js regularly to the latest Long Term
Support (LTS) version.
